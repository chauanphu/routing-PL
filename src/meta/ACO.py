        Initializes the ACO optimizer for VRPPL using a single 3D pheromone matrix.
        
        The 3D pheromone matrix has dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) x 2, where n is the number of customers.
        The first index represents the "from" node (with 0 representing the depot and 1..n representing customers),
        the second index represents the "to" customer (always in 1..n), and the third dimension represents the 
        delivery decision: index 0 for home delivery and index 1 for locker delivery.
        
        For each customer:
          - Type I: only home delivery is allowed (locker branch is forced to 0).
          - Type II: only locker delivery is allowed (home branch is forced to 0).
          - Type III: both options are learnable.
        
        In a solution construction, when moving from a current node (starting at the depot) to an unvisited customer j,
        the ant considers each allowed delivery mode d. The probability of selecting candidate j with decision d is
        proportional to:
             (pheromone[from, j, d]^alpha) * ( (1/distance)^beta )
        where distance is computed between the current location and the candidate's location (customer's house if d==0,
        or assigned locker if d==1).
        
        After selecting a candidate, the composite decision (j, d) is appended to the route. For example, if from depot 0
        an ant selects customer 7 with decision 1 (locker), then the ant will visit customer 7â€™s assigned locker.
